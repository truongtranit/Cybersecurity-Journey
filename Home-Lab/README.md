# My Cybersecurity Home Lab

This document outlines the architecture and components of my personal cybersecurity home lab. The environment is built on enterprise-grade hardware and uses network segmentation via VLANs to simulate a realistic corporate network.

The purpose of this lab is to provide a sandboxed environment for practicing penetration testing techniques, understanding network security controls, and studying for advanced certifications.
