Welcome to my learning portfolio! My name is Thanh Truong Tran, and I am a software Development graduate transitioning into the field of cybersecurity with a focus on penetration testing.
This repository is a collection of my notes, projects, and hands-on work as I study for my certifications and build the practical skills needed for a security role.
